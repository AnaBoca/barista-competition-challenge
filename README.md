Web page published to github-pages at: **[barista-competition-challenge](https://anaboca.github.io/barista-competition-challenge/)**.

### ✔️ Project Requirements:

- Create a competitor registration web page for the "Barista Competition" based on the provided press release and Instagram post.
- The registration form should capture the barista's name, email, and phone number.

### ⚙️ Primary Technologies Used:

- Bootstrap 4
- CSS3
- HTML5
- JavaScript - ES6
- Sass
- Webpack

### 📇 Feature Highlights:

- The page uses Webpack so that assets are bundled and minified lowering the number of HTTP requests and improving load times.
- The page uses responsive, mobile-first design.
- The registration form includes client-side validation with a simulated backend that runs the same validation logic.
- The application includes a `loadVideoIfNetworkIsGood()` function that will only load the background video
  if the network has a connection of 3g or 4g and if the user does not choose to save data on a mobile device.
- Large images were optimized using [Squoosh.app](https://squoosh.app/).
